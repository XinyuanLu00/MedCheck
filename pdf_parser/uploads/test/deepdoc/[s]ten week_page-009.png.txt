Figure 5 illustrates statistical correlations of glucose and insulin values with changes
in the relative abundance of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Blautia coccoides after water or
sucralose consumption. In the control group, participants exhibited a positive correlation
 between AUCG and AUCI (r = 0.60, p = 0.01) (Figure 5A). AUCG also displayed a strong
inverse correlation with Lactobacillus acidophilus (r = -0.56, p = 0.02) (Figure 5A). In turn,
Bifidobacterium longum had a positive association with Lactobacillus acidophilus (r = 0.51,
 p = 0.03) (Figure 5A). Sucralose consumption considerably modified the intrinsic associa-
 tions of gut microbiota with glucose and insulin levels. Volunteers in the sucralose group
exhibited a positive association of AUCG with AUCI (r= 0.63, p < 0.01) (Figure 5B). More-
over, AUCG displayed strong inverse correlations with Lactobacillus acidophilus (r = -0.59,
p < 0.02) and Blautia coccoides (r = -0.53, p < 0.02) (Figure 5B). Unexpectedly, AUCI exhib-
ited a strong inverse relationship with Lactobacillus acidophilus (r = -0.55, p < 0.02), while
Lactobacillus acidophilus showed a significant positive correlation with Bacteroides uniformis
(r = 0.57, p < 0.02) (Figure 5B).
