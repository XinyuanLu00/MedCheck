that would allow us to properly characterize the changes in all of the bacterial species
in the human gut. Finally, we should evaluate the impact of sucralose consumption
on glucose and insulin blood values using a different method to OGTT that allows for
better reproducibility.
5. Conclusions
This clinical trial demonstrates, for the first time, that consumption of 48 mg of
sucralose every day for ten weeks induces gut dysbiosis by increasing Blautia coccoides and
decreasing Lactobacillus acidophilus in healthy non-insulin-resistant young adults. As far as
we know, this is one of the first long-term clinical trials showing that sucralose amounts,
far lower than the suggested ADI, alter the balance of the gut microbiome, while also
being associated with significant elevations in AUCG and serum insulin in response to
glucoseloads
