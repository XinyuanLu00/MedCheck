At the beginning and end of the study, participants who completed the ten-week water
 or sucralose consumption showed similar demographic, anthropometric, laboratory pa-
 rameters, physical activity levels, and dietary nutrient intake (Table 1). However, sucralose
ingestion for ten weeks significantly altered glucose and insulin levels in response to a
 glucose load.

We express data as mean ± standard deviation except for gender and physical activity that we show as absolute
values. Depending on the group comparison, we estimated significant differences using the Wilcoxon matched-
 pairs signed-rank test or the Mann-Whitney U test except for gender and physical activity that we assessed by
the chi-squared test. We considered a difference as significant when p < 0.05. a Parameters at the beginning
of the study in the control group, b parameters at the end of the study in the control group, parameters at
the beginning of the study in the sucralose group, d parameters at the end of the study in the sucralose group.
Abbreviations: w, women; m, men; BMI, body mass index; SBP, systolic blood pressure; DBP, diastolic blood
pressure; HbA1c, glycated hemoglobin; HOMA-IR, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance; LDL,
low-density lipoprotein; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; a.u., arbitrary units; kcal, kilocalories.
In controls, blood glucose values at the different time points of the OGTT showed no
significant differences at the beginning (0 weeks) and end (10 weeks) of the study (inter-
action p value = 0.20) (Figure 2A). Likewise, serum insulin levels at the different time points
of the OGTT exhibited no significant differences at the beginning and end of the study
(interaction p value = 0.78) (Figure 2B). Volunteers drinking sucralose for ten weeks tended
to display higher blood glucose values at all time points of the OGTT than those found
 basally at the beginning of the study. However, no significant differences were reached
(interaction p value = 0.89) (Figure 2C). Conversely, participants consuming sucralose
for ten weeks exhibited a significant 32 ± 3.5% increase in the serum insulin maximum
 peak at 30 min of the OGTT compared to that found basally at the beginning of the study
(p < 0.001) (Figure 2D).
The area under the curve (AUC) of glucose and insulin confirmed what we found in
OGTTs (Figure 3). At the beginning of the study, there were no differences between control
and sucralose groups for the AUC of glucose (AUCG) (p = 0.99) (Figure 3A). Likewise,
volunteers drinking water for ten weeks showed a similar AUCG than that found basally
