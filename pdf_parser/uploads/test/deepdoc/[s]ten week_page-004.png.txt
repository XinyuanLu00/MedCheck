USA). We used the Spearman's correlation model to calculate coefficients (r) and p values
of the changes in bacterial abundance with AUC of insulin (AUCI) and AUC of glucose
(AUCG) in control and sucralose groups, using the R i386 3.5.2 terminal. We considered a
difference as significant when p < 0.05.
3. Results
Figure 1 illustrates the selection process of participants enrolled in the study. After
 meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria, we eliminated seven participants from the study
because they refused to attend at least 80% of weekly appointments. (Figure 1).
Participants that met eligible criteria (n= 63):
1)Age 18-35 years
2)HOMA-IR≤2.5
 3)BMI 18.5-29.9 kg/m2
4) Acceptance to adhere to a dietary plan and
avoid consuming other sources of NAS
5)  Acceptance to sign the informed consent 
Exclusion criteria:
1)Diagnosis or treatment for non-communicable
 diseases, endocrine disorders, infectious
diseases, malabsorption disorder, short bowel
syndrome, functional gastrointestinal
 disorders, and inflammatory or autoimmune 
 disease
 2)Use of antibiotics for the last 6 months
 3) Pregnancy or lactation
