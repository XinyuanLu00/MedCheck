(p = 0.87) (Figure 3A). At the end of the study, we observed no differences between control
and sucralose groups for the AUCG again (p = 0.27) (Figure 3A). Conversely, volunteers
drinking sucralose for ten weeks exhibited a significant 8 ± 1.7% higher AUCG than that
found basally at the beginning of the study (p = 0.02) (Figure 3A). The AUC of insulin
(AUCl) showed no differences between control and sucralose groups at the beginning
(p = 0.99) and end (p = 0.96) of the study (Figure 3B). In parallel, participants drinking
water (p = 0.94) or sucralose (p = 0.83) for ten weeks exhibited similar AUCIs to those found
basally at the beginning of the study (Figure 3B).

Figure 2. Blood levels of glucose and insulin during oral glucose tolerance test. (A) Volunteers
receiving water for ten weeks showed no differences in blood glucose curves compared to the
beginning of the study (O weeks). (B) Participants receiving water for ten weeks exhibited no
 differences in serum insulin curves compared to the beginning of the study. (C) Volunteers drinking
sucralose for ten weeks showed no diferences in blood glucose curves compared to the beginning
of the study. (D) Participants consuming sucralose for ten weeks exhibited a significant increase
in serum insulin, with the maximum peak occurring 30 min after glucose load, compared to that
found at the beginning of the study. We show control and sucralose groups at O weeks in closed
circles, whereas both groups are shown in open circles at ten weeks. We express data as mean
± standard deviation. We estimated significant differences by two-tailed 2-way ANOVA with
Bonferroni correction. Asterisks (*) indicate significant differences when p < 0.05.
