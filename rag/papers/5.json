The accuracy of CGM among healthy populations has not been widely assessed. This study assessed agreement between glucose concentrations obtained from venous plasma and from CGM (FreeStyle Libre2TM, Abbott Diabetes Care, Witney, UK) in healthy women. Glucose concentrations were assessed after fasting and every 15 min after a standardized breakfast over a 4-h lab period. Accuracy of CGM was determined by Bland-Altman plot, 15/15% sensor agreement analysis, Clarke error grid analysis (EGA) and mean absolute relative difference (MARD). In all, 429 valid CGM readings with paired venous plasma glucose (VPG) values were obtained from 29 healthy women. Mean CGM readings were 1.14 mmol/L (95% CI: 0.97 to 1.30 mmol/L, p < 0.001) higher than VPG concentrations. Ratio 95% limits of agreement were from 0.68 to 2.20, and a proportional bias (slope: 0.22) was reported. Additionally, 45% of the CGM readings were within ±0.83 mmol/L (±15 mg/dL) or ±15% of VPG, while 85.3% were within EGA Zones A + B (clinically acceptable). MARD was 27.5% (95% CI: 20.8, 34.2%), with higher MARD values in the hypoglycaemia range and when VPG concentrations were falling.
