In line with this information, we\nconfirmed that long-term sucralose consumption causes dysbiosis in healthy non-insulin\nresistant young adults, affecting the relative abundance of bacteria mainly belonging to the\nphylum Firmicutes.\n In humans, the gut microbiome is composed of over 3 Ã— 1013 bacteria [16], among\nwhich the phylum Firmicutes appear to play a central role in the metabolism of glucose\nand insulin [17]. Sucralose ingestion increases the relative amount of Firmicutes as hy-\nperglycemia and insulin resistance rise in mice [3]. Patients with hyperinsulinemia and\nglucose intolerance show a higher intestinal abundance of Firmicutes, especially Blautia\ncoccoides [18-20]. Blautia coccoides seem to counter the abnormal glucose and insulin home-\nostasis in patients with metabolic syndrome by producing butyrate that contributes to\nmaintaining normal blood glucose levels [21,22]. Interestingly, we found that sucralose\ningestion instigates an inverse relationship between AUCG and Blautia coccoides, which\nmay decrease butyrate levels, inducing increased glucose release during the OGTT. Al-\nthough plausible, this hypothesis still needs to be responded to by measuring butyrate\nlevels to know whether changes in the intestinal abundance of Blautia coccoides may lead to\nvariations in this metabolite and, consequently, an elevation in the AUCG.",
